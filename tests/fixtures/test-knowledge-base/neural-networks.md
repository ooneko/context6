# Neural Networks and Deep Learning

## Introduction to Neural Networks

Artificial neural networks are computing systems inspired by biological neural networks. They consist of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers that process information using connectionist approaches.

## Architecture Components

### 1. Neurons (Nodes)
Basic units that receive inputs, apply weights and biases, and produce outputs through activation functions.

### 2. Layers
- **Input Layer**: Receives raw data
- **Hidden Layers**: Process features and patterns
- **Output Layer**: Produces final predictions

### 3. Activation Functions
- **ReLU**: Rectified Linear Unit (most common)
- **Sigmoid**: For binary classification
- **Tanh**: Hyperbolic tangent
- **Softmax**: For multi-class classification

## Training Process

### Backpropagation
The fundamental algorithm for training neural networks:
1. Forward pass: Input flows through the network
2. Calculate loss using loss function
3. Backward pass: Compute gradients
4. Update weights using optimization algorithms

### Optimization Algorithms
- **Gradient Descent**: Basic optimization method
- **Adam**: Adaptive moment estimation
- **RMSprop**: Root mean square propagation
- **SGD with Momentum**: Stochastic gradient descent with momentum

## Common Challenges

### Overfitting
When the model memorizes training data instead of learning patterns. Solutions:
- Dropout layers
- L1/L2 regularization
- Early stopping
- Data augmentation

### Vanishing/Exploding Gradients
Problems in deep networks where gradients become too small or too large.

## Advanced Architectures

### Autoencoders
Neural networks designed for unsupervised learning of efficient data encodings.

### Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
Two neural networks competing against each other to generate realistic data.

### Attention Mechanisms
Allow networks to focus on specific parts of the input, crucial for modern NLP.
