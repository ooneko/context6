# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## What is Machine Learning?

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

## Types of Machine Learning

### 1. Supervised Learning
Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn the relationship between input and output. Common algorithms include:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Neural Networks

### 2. Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised learning finds hidden patterns in unlabeled data. Key techniques:
- Clustering (K-means, DBSCAN)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA, t-SNE)
- Anomaly Detection

### 3. Reinforcement Learning
RL trains agents to make sequences of decisions by rewarding desired behaviors.

## Deep Learning

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers. Key architectures include:

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
Primarily used for image processing and computer vision tasks.

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
Designed for sequential data like time series or natural language.

### Transformers
Revolutionary architecture that powers modern NLP models like BERT and GPT.

## Applications

- **Computer Vision**: Image classification, object detection, facial recognition
- **Natural Language Processing**: Language translation, sentiment analysis, chatbots
- **Recommendation Systems**: Content recommendations on streaming platforms
- **Autonomous Vehicles**: Self-driving cars use ML for perception and decision-making
